/*
    This traits can be useful in the future if one wants to switch to an approach where every
    model has its own quasi-folded type.

    At the moment, every model used by the decoder has a `quasi_folded` an u64. These traits allow
    for the usage of u32 with 3 bits reserved to represent the number of folds.
